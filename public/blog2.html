                <p> Second week DONE! This week was absolutely fantastic!  </p>
    
                <p> The schedule was a repeat of Week 1, and I already felt more comfortable with the routine. My first week, I would get my workouts in after work, but this week I had an early morning workout, 2 lunch workouts and a morning run on the weekend. The benefit of my morning workout was seeing the most beautiful sunrise!</p>
    
                <p> Music... what do I listen to? Since I am building my 'Pre-Base' for the next 20 weeks, my runs are not supposed to be too difficult, and my heart rate shouldn't be too high. Because of that, my go-to for running lately has been listening to audiobooks. I currently am listening to, <u>Let Your Mind Run</u>, by Deena Kastor. A well-known running phenom, who has a very motivational and upbeat book to listen to while training for my own running fitness. She talks a lot about her running journey, but also about how she built a mindset of a champion. As for lifting weights, I listen to anything pop but not too upbeat.</p> 
    
                <p> This week, I again started out with a 20 minute walk on Monday, 15 minute run on Tuesday, strength training on Wednesday, switched it up to a 20 minute run on Thurdsday and a 30 minute long run on Saturday.</p>

                <p> Nutrition! Okay, so this is something I am really trying to pay attention to. I have been plant-based for about 6 years now, and making sure I am getting the right foods during my marathon training adventure is key. I have found that if I don't prepare my meals before my day gets started, I don't do a great job of feeding myself at the right times. So! For breakfast I varied it up with some ovenight oats one morning, and whole grain toast with cashew butter, flax seed meal, hemp seeds, banana and a drizzle of honey (<em>omg amazing</em>). This week I made jarred salads with kale, tomatoes, green apples and celery. I add some vegan chicken as well. For dinners this ranged from Thai curries to pasta dishes with tond and tons of veggies.  </p>
    
                <p> Total mileage (walk/run) for the second week: <strong> 6.87 miles</strong></p>
