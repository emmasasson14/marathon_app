                <p>Week 9 was a week of EVENTS!! </p>
                &nbsp;
                <p> This week challeneged me immensely, as I picked up mileage throughout the week, and ran in different environments, with different groups of people who really pushed my pace. Starting the week off on a Tuesday evening, I decided to join the first "Cool Down Running" Group run at Sloan Lake. Every Tuesday evening, over 100 people show up for one or two loops around the 2.5 mile around lake in Denver. I felt really good for most of the run, but wanted to stay with a group that was about my pace, but slightly faster. By the end of the run, I knew I had pushed myself, as I was aching, and my running form did not stay as smooth as it usually had been.</p>
                &nbsp;
                <p> After this run, I took upped my recovery methods immensely. My hip was extremely tight, so I rolled out, stretched and iced more than usual to help!By Thursday, I was ready to shake off the fast run on the treadmill for some easy pace miles. I still felt a bit tight, but not in pain, and was able to run off the Tuesday group run.</p>

                <p> This week was a bit more restful, no actual weight training at the gym, but I am continuing on with doing bands and mobilty close to almost each night. The end of the week was another fun 5k community even put on my the same running group I had run with on Tuesday. I brought my husband along for the slightly longer than 5k, 5k... and ran a nice cool 3.41 miles to end the week around downtown, the river, and Mile High Stadium. </p>

                &nbsp;
                <p> As part of my recovery, I am definitely making sure I am physically taking care of my body with mobilty, rolling out and stretching, but I am also raising the bar when it comes to nutrition. As a plant-based eater, I have gotten used to being creative in the kitchen, and have happened upon some amazing super-foods like: quinoa, spirulina powder, and turmeric to name a few.</p>
                &nbsp;
                <p> Total running mileage this week: <strong>8.34</strong></p>
