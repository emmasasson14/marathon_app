                <p> Week 11 in the &#128218;!</p>

                &nbsp;
                <p> HUNGRY? I feel like the past two weeks, my metabolism has significantly increased the point where I feel like I am thinking about food so much more! Because of this, I want to make sure that when I am feeling hungry, it is really easy to reach for quick snack calories that are not the healthiest option. On Sundays I have started my bulk food prep so I can have easy grab meals throughout the week!</p>

                &nbsp;
                <p>Now I don't technically serve portions out for each meal, but rather, I just started making what my husband calls, "Emma's delight", because I didn't really have a recipe for it the first time I cooked it up, but rather I cooked whatever looked good in my fridge!</p>

                &nbsp;
                <p> To make it, I started out with heating up some minced garlic on the stove. I then added green lentils, chopped potatoes, butternut squash, red apples, oranges, veggie broth, carrots, chopped dates and kale. I mixed in all the fall spices that I absolutely love including: cinnamon, allspice, ginger and a touch of maple syrup. In a separate pan, I made some brown rice as well that I later added to the stew. Voila! I had food for lunch and dinners for the next 4 days! </p>

                &nbsp;
                <p> On top of keeping my nutrition up, I have also been making sure I have kept up with my mental game, meaning, I have been reading some books to keep me motivated on my runs! I just finished, "26 Marathons: What I Learned About Faith, Identity, Running, and Life from My Marathon Career " by the famous, American running hero, Meb Keflezighi, read by Scott Douglas (I listened to the audiobook).</p>
    
                &nbsp;

                <p> This book was inspiring in so many ways, and it was a wonderful way to learn about someone who not only immigrated to America at such a young age, who fled with his family from his homeland of war-torn Eritrea, but also how he stood up and faced diversity in America and became a national hero. His triumphs and his woes were extremely inspiring to listen to, and I look forward to my next read! </p>
                
                &nbsp;
              <p> Okay back to running eh? Running was chill this week, but the best part was I did end my week with a great outdoor hill workout in the beautiful weather that has hit Denver, Colorado in March! Hills were tough, but also a lovely challenge. The increased weight workouts have definitely been something I am feeling especially in the hips, so working on incorporating more stretching and rolling out as usual!</p>

        

              <p> Weekly schedule was made up of: Morning weights on Monday, an easy 20 min run on Tuesday, followed by a 25 min run on Thursday, and ending with two workouts on Saturday, well okay the like walk was not at first planned, but did finish up with a 40 min hilly chill run!</p>
              
    
            <p> Total running mileage:: <strong> 7.03 miles</strong></p>
