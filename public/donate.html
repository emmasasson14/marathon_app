<h1>Team for Kids</h1>
<p></p>
<p>On November 5, 2023, I will be participating in the New York City Marathon to raise money through <a href="https://runwithtfk.org/" target="_blank">Team for Kids</a> for <a href="https://www.nyrr.org/youth"target="_blank">New York Road Runners </a> youth programs. I am especially motivated to benefit such a worthy cause!!</p>

&nbsp;

<p> Growing up, sports were, and continue to be, a huge part of my life. Sports has made me the person I am today. I learned lessons of teamwork, commitment, and the importance of maintaining overall physical, mental and emotional health.</p>

&nbsp;

<p><a href="https://www.nyrr.org/youth" target="_blank">Rising New York Road Runners</a> - NYRRâ€™s youth program and events platform - serves more than 240,000 students locally and nationally through free NYRR youth running programs, events, and resources. These programs promote healthy lifestyles and empower youth development via running and character-building programs in schools and community centers nationwide.</p>

&nbsp;

<p>I have two goals over the next few months. The first being to finish my FIRST EVER MARATHON! The second would be to raise $2,620 for NYRR youth programs, and you can find my fundraising page at this <a href="https://runwithtfk.org/Profile/PublicPage/102110" target="_blank">link</a>. Your donation is fully tax deductible and you will receive an email letter of acknowledgment for your tax records.</p>

&nbsp;
<p>Please join me in supporting this cause and get kids running toward a brighter, healthier future!</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Emma</p>

&nbsp;
<p>P.S. Ask an employer about doubling your donation!</p>
