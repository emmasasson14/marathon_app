                <p> Wow, a fifth week already completed. As the weeks go by, I am definitely starting to feel my body get stronger, and more used to running on a consistent basis. </p>

                <p> This week was fun and yet challenging at the same time both physically and mentally. My feet have slightly become a bit more sore over the last few weeks and I am really working on maintaining my recovery routine where I make sure to include strengthening exercises, icing and stretching. I also tried to get new shoes this week, but they just did not fit right!! This is SO IMPORTANT. Make sure you get shoes that are best for YOUR feet. </p>

                <p> Another challenge, but a bit more exciting was running in below 10&#8451; F at a whopping 6&#8451; F. WOW. I definitely was surprised at how warm I did feel... (<em>though the 4 layers, gloves, head band and face mask did help a ton.</em>)  </p>

                <p>That day was quite the chilly day, plus it was snowing which actually made it quite beautiful as well. I also got to run with a new running group right here in Denver, which was a nice change of pace... pun most definitely intended. To top it all off, I found a nice fireplace in a nearby REI right after my long run to thaw out! </p>
    
                <p> Total mileage (walk/run) for the week: <strong>7.23 miles</strong></p>
