        <h2> Introduction </h2>

            <p> Okay, here it is! It is officially official... I have started my New York City Marathon training journey and I couldn't be more excited, nervous, confused, scared, elated... and welp, pumped. So as to not be overly cliché by announcing this as my 2023 New Years Resolution, I, in fact, started this goal a week <em>before </em> New Years... thank you very much. Just in case marathon training wasn't hard enough on its own &#128517 ... I have also decided to track my journey in front of the world, in front of YOU, on this website, that I am also at the same time learning how to build. So like not too much going on this year... </p>
            
            <p>So why am I doing this you ask? Well, growing up, I was always outside, always playing sports, always moving. I was a collegiate water polo athlete for all four years, and now, being a graduated sort of adult person, with a new job that requires a lot of sitting around, I have missed the thrill of challenging my body physically, my mind mentally, and I want to push my body farther than it ever has gone before. A marathon is 26.2 miles long, and I intend to complete one on November 5, 2023. </p>
            
            <p>Okay, but why the website? Why not just post on your Insta story? Well, I will be! But, I also want to learn how to program, and how to build websites, and why not test this out with something that means a lot to me?
            </p>

            <p> My goal with this page is to document each week's worth of physical and mental training, recovery and nutrition to share with all of you! I hope that this is something that is not only valuable to me, but also to those of you who are reading.</p>

            <p> To preface, I have a background of mostly water sports. I was a swimmer from the ages 7 to 11, and played water polo through high school and college until the graduting in 2016. The year after I swore off pools for 365 days, and decided to run a half marathon. I did end up completing it, but not without major pain from my hips to my toes for about a month afterwards. I sort of trained okay by following a running plan, but I was not great at focusing on my strengh, mobility and recovery so it wasn't really the most enjoyable journey. This time, I want it to be the opposite of my last race. I want to focus on building a solid base for the next few months so that I can be the strongest runner I can be. Thank you for following along, and well... let's run!</p>
