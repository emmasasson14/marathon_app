                <p> Here we are, 10 weeks into training, and I couldn't be more excited. What made this week even more special, was that I officially got myself registered for the 2023 NYC Marathon!! I have been signed up since December, but I finally got my regiatration finalized, which means IT'S HAPPENING!! </p>

                &nbsp;
                <p> Training has been fun lately. I feel like I truly am getting stronger, and runs have been feeling easier and easier. I have been adding a bit more weight to my strength sessions, which has inevitably been making me more hungry &#128517;.</p>
                &nbsp;
                <p>On top of being more hungry, at the end of the training week, I also was feeling a little more tired, which makes sense since I was putting more work into lifting. All in all though, it was a chill run week, all runs were on the treadmill and kept it nice and smooth.</p>

                &nbsp;
                <p> This week, I started out with an easy 30 min run on Monday, weights on Tuesday, 25 min run on Wednesday, and then hit 35 minutes again for an easy long run on Saturday. Every other day I try to hit up the roller ball, roller, stretch routine and mobility. Not to mention the icing on those sore spots.</p>
