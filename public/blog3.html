                <p> Third week COMPLETE!</p>
    
                <p> So this week was the first week that my weights and run schedule shifted to where I started the week with a lift and THEN a run... Welp, Tuesday's run... I could feel those weights. I was definitely more tight, and I felt a bit slower, but as the week went on, I could feel my strength building.</p>
    
                <p> My long run this week was at our beautiful nearby Sloan Lake in Denver, Colorado. The loop is about 2.5 miles around, and it a perfect 30 minute location on a relaxed run day. However, this week also included some obstacles as the snow has been melting, and I also paid extra attention to those slippery icy spots! &#10052&#10052</p> 
    
                <p> Monday began with weights, followed by a light 15 minute run on Tuesday, a 30 min Wednesday walk, 20 minute walk on Thursday, and rounded it out with a 30 minute long run on Saturday.</p>

                <p> Recovery, recovery , recovery! My right foot has had a creeping pain on the top for the past couple of weeks, but has significantly improved after consistent icing and rest in between workouts. I also have been making sure to roll out whether with my rolling ball or roller to hit all the soft tissue to ensure speedy recovery.</p>
                
    
                <p> Total mileage (walk/run) for the third week week: <strong> 6.99 miles</strong></p>
