                <p> First week DONE! This marathon journey is going to be exactly that, <em> a journey</em> and I am excited to have a chance to really enjoy every single part of the process and be in the moment. </p>
    
                <p> Since I have never done this before, I have decided to look up a helpful guide to running my first marathon. After researching, I happened upon a wonderful book written by, Ali Nolan, called <u>Master the Marathon</u>. Ali Nolan is a well-known journalist and writer who has had plenty of running experience and has completed her fair share of marathons. What drew me to this book was that it was curated for women's bodies in particular. Googling plans on the internet is definitely one way to train, and I did that method for my one and only half marathon a few years ago. Though, after getting hurt, and not really feeling well after that run, I was excited to find a guide specifically for women.</p>
    
                <p> There are multiple training guides in this book for every level runner, and for me, I am starting out as a beginner/intermediate. So for the next 22 weeks, I am setting up what Ali calls, "Pre-Base". This is essentially priming my body for what's to come. It mixes a balanced about of light runs (all time-based), body weight workouts, walking and rest throughout the week.</p>
    
                <p> This week, I started out with a 20 minute walk on Monday, 15 minute run on Tuesday, strength training on Wednesday, a 15 minute run on Thurdsday and a 30 minute long run on Sunday. I had to switch up the days a bit this week as I was out of town, but hey... gotta remain flexible and get all my workouts in when and where I can!</p>
    
                <p> As for recovery, I love my foam roller, and I also got myself a roller ball to hit my feet as well before and after working out. Oh also, my two pugs wanted to make sure my feet were in great condition... </p>

                <p> I also should mention, before any workout, I go through a <em> dynamic warmup </em>. I cannot tell you what a game changer this is. This warms your body up for what's to come, and it has significantly helped me feel evem more primed up for my workout. For me this week, I mixed in some lunges with twists, leg swings, toe and heel walks, along with some butt kickers and high knees to get ready. </p>
    
                <p> Total mileage (walk/run) for the first week: <strong> 5.67 miles</strong></p>
