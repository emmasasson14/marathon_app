                <p>Well, I have officially made it to 2 MONTHS of pre-base marathon training. Holy cow!! Setting the pre-base for this race has been a test of both commitment and patience. I have committed not only to training, but also making sure I am taking care of my body by continously eating well, massaging, stretching and doing exercises to strengthen my swimmer body to be a land creature, and getting plenty of fluids and sleep. </p>
    
                <p> As for patience, this is an incredibly long and beautiful journey, and I am trusting that I am setting up a foundation for my body to be able to take on more strenuous running training in a few months. This can take time, and the end goal date in 259 days seems so far, but I want to give my body the healthiest set up for my end goal.</p>
    
                <p> This was week was a really fun one because I got to do a Valentine's Day run with my husband at nearby river about a mile away. It was a brisk morning, and honestly, one of the hardest runs I have been on thus far. It wasn't the distance, but rather the pace was a bit quicker, and there were so many more hills than I have tackeled on my very flat, chill tradmill workouts. &#128517;</p>
    
                <p> All in all though, it was a great run, and I pushed myself harder than I have been on my past runs, proving to myself that I am stronger than I think sometimes.</p>

                <p> Another fun highlight of the week was my first 5k during this marathon training block. Every Saturday in Boulder, there is a community 5k that traverses through a wooded path. Before this, I would have told you that my Valentine's Day run was my hardest... this one took the cake though. Snow had just falled a few days prior, and the terrain was snowy, icy and muddy for the entire 3.1 miles. The entire run, I was watching my footing, hoping not to fall or twist something, but I did feel strong. My foot still bothers me a bit, and the constant ankle bending and balancing game I played proved to be a challenge. But I finished. </p>
    
               
                
    
                <p> Total running mileage this week: <strong>8.28</strong></p>
