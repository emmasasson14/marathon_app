                <p> Week 7, here we go!  </p>
    
                <p> This schedule was a bit different, as I did have a friend come to visit this week, so I had a running buddy and a slightly different schedule.</p>
    
                <p> I had two runs this week, but did a but of unplanned cross-training with short walks up some steep hills at the Red Rocks Ampitheatre along with a hot yoga class as well!</p> 
    
                <p> This week we started out with a lift on Monday, a 1.8, 15 min cruise mile run Tuesday,a hot yoga session on Wednesday, a 2.7 fun run with friends on Saturday, and another yoga session to round out the week on Sunday. </p>

                <p>Another update with my foot pain from the previous week. It has definitely been getting better, and I ended up heading over to Road Runner Sports to get my feet analyzed. If you have not done this before, you get to hop on a treadmill barefoot, and they take a video of how your foot lands. Then, you step on a foot scanner where it anaylizes your foot arch. So it turns out that both feet of mine have high arches, but my right foot has an incedibly high arch. I had no arch support from my shoes, so I kept my shoes the same, but we added a unique set of arch support insoles to my shoes that they craft by molding your feet right there at the store! My shoes feel good, and feet feel better, so we are on the mend. :)  </p>
    
                <p> Total mileage (run) for the seventh week: <strong> 4.5 miles</strong></p>
