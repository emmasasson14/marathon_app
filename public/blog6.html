                <p> Welp, this completes my 6th week of marathon training, as part of my 'Pre-Base' which is essentially 19 weeks of getting my body used to this whole running thing. As a former water polo player, who really was in a pool for about 11 years straight, this whole including "gravity" thing has been interesting to say the least. </p>

                <p> This week was was the first week I had to take a few extra rest days as tendonitis has been creeping up ever so slightly on the top of my right foot. I had been icing at least twice a day last week, but this week the pain had gotten to a point where my body was telling me to stop. It was Wednesday evening, I was on my 30 minute walk, and I ended up stopping 10 minutes in. </p>

                <p> I used to work with a someone who ran quite often and would say, <em>listen to your body whisper so you never have to hear it scream.</em> I took her advice this week, rested, iced, and ended up getting new running shoes! </p>

                <p>The first pair I tried on, I thought would be a success... a few days later, I realized that those shoes really were not great for my feet, so I went for the upgraded version of my old running shoes, the Hoka Mach 5s. They are AMAZING. I ended the week with a 30 min, 2.17 mile run with the new shoes. </p>
    
                <p> Total mileage run for the week: <strong>3.44</strong></p>
