                <p> It has officially been <strong>1 WHOLE MONTH</strong> of training thus far, and I can honestly say that I am pretty stoked. I feel more at ease with my runs, and I am getting used to the consistent workout plans. Pain-wise, I am feeling mostly healthy, but maybe a little more sore in my feet. The top of of my right foot has been acting up a bit this week with a little more soreness, so I have been icing almost every day. </p>

                <p>This was week was a fun one for me, not only because it was my first month into training, but because I spent some time in my hometown of San Diego, CA. My running paths were a bit different this week, and I got to add more elevation, hills, and variety to my workout. The <em>only</em> bummer was that I also had my first trip and fall this week, but only got myself a nice bruise and scratch, and thankfully, nothing else! I didn't pick up my foot high enough on the sidewalk, and BAM, hit the pavement. It was only about halfway through my first longer run of the week, but I felt fine, and continued on. </p>

                <p> Overall, it was a beautiful week, and I got to add another 30 minute run to my schedule. Upped the time and mileage, and even added a yoga session for fun. I am incredibly grateful for the new terrain, and the beautiful weather I got to experience this week. </p>

                <p> I was a bit sick on Monday, so I moved light weights to Tuesday, followed by a light 15 minute run on Wednesday, a 30 min Thursday walk, 30 minute run on Friday, a hot yoga session on Saturday and rounded it out with a 30 minute long run on Sunday.</p>
    
                <p> Total mileage (walk/run) for the week: <strong> 8.55 miles</strong></p>
